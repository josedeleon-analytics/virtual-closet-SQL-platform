Welcome to the GitHub repository for my final project in **ITC6000: Database Management Systems** at Northeastern University. This project demonstrates the end-to-end design of a relational database application built around sustainable fashion, AI recommendations, and social commerce.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Virtual Closet Platform** is a mobile and web-based application that enables users to:

- Upload and organize their wardrobe
- Create and share outfits ("Looks")
- Try on clothes virtually using Augmented Reality (AR)
- Buy, sell, or swap second-hand clothing
- Receive personalized AI-powered fashion recommendations

The goal is to promote **sustainability** by extending the lifecycle of clothing through peer-to-peer exchange and digital wardrobe management.

## 🧑‍🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- Database modeling and normalization  
- SQL query design for CRUD operations and analytics  
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)  
- Implementing bridge tables for many-to-many relationships  
- Understanding cloud-based architecture and data privacy  

---

## 💡 SQL Highlights

Key queries implemented:

- Resale tracking per item
- Revenue summaries by seller
- Top resold clothing categories
- Versatility of clothing in different Looks
- Pricing insights based on item condition

Each query supports a real feature or metric in the app.

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

The platform handles sensitive data, including:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Body measurements and style preferences
- Transaction metadata

Precautions taken:

- Role-based access control  
- SQL injection prevention  
- GDPR-aligned privacy practices  

---

## 🌐 Architecture

The application is built on a cloud-based **3-tier architecture**:

- **Presentation Layer**: Web and mobile interface  
- **Application Layer**: Business logic, APIs, AI/AR modules  
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL deployed on cloud infrastructure  

📌 Refer to the [ER diagram](erd/ER%20diagram.jpg) for the schema overview.

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Integrate machine learning for enhanced recommendations  
- Implement OAuth 2.0 and advanced user authentication  
- Expand AR try-on features  
- Add logistics modules for shipping and returns
